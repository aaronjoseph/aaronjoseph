I'm a **Data Scientist** focusing on applied **Machine Learning**. I have more than four years of experience building solutions and solve exciting and hard problems.

Bonus points if I can collaborate with a team of like-minded Data Scientists!

I joined Kaleidofin as employee number 70, at Seed stage. Worked crazy hours working on providing financial solution for the underbanked customers in India. Developed end-to-end system from Data Engineering (Postgres, Indexing Data, Sharding) to Modeling (Financial Optimization). Had real fun and made significant impact to the rural customers of India and leant a lot about personal finance.

A place where my DS career started, and for many. Just the right starting place.
Don't ask me how I circumvented the 3 year bond, or maybe do ask, at a coffee shop :)

### My education

**B.E. Electronics and Communication | BMSIT**

**OTHER CERTIFICATIONS**

* [TensorFlow Developer Certificate (Google)](images/tensorflow-developer-certificate.png)
* [Machine Learning (Standford Online - Coursera)](images/machine-learning.png)
* [TensorFlow In Practice (deeplearning.ai - Coursera)](images/tensorflow-in-practice.png)
* [Developing Scalable Apps with Java and Google App Engine (Google - Udacity)](images/developing-apps-java-app-engine.png)
* [Mobile Web Development (Google - Udacity)](images/mobile-web-development.png)

I've also accumulated other certifications from 2001 to 2015 covering OO Concepts, Java, C, JavaScript, and C# development.

### My most relevant technical skills

These are the highlights of the skills I consider to be the keystone of my abilities:

* I have a lot of experience **designing** and **architecting** systems of different sizes and complexity.
* I've become an excellent **Python** üêç developer. And this happened after years dedicated to **Java**.
* I have a lot of experience with **Machine Learning** using **TensorFlow**.
* I have been focusing mainly on **AWS**. It's the place where most of my work goes to serve its purpose.
* I have substantial experience dealing with **relational databases** (mainly MySQL), and **non-relational** ones (Amazon's DynamoDB, Google's Firestore, and MongoDB.)
* I've done a lot of front-end development, and at some point, I was pretty good using **Angular**.

### Some of the things I've built

It's hard to decide what things should make it into this list, so I'm opting for a combination of private and public projects where I've participated over the last ten years.

* A Python library that orchestrates a workflow of images between different services deployed in AWS.
* An application that connects to [Spot's](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot) cameras, and makes the robot react to visual clues.
* A process using OpenCV and TensorFlow to analyze a video feed and flag break-ins into an amusement park.
* A [library](https://github.com/svpino/rfeed) to generate RSS 2.0 feeds in Python.
* A [project](https://github.com/svpino/tensorflow-object-detection-sagemaker) to run TensorFlow Object Detection models on SageMaker.
* A very simple and fully responsive file system-based [blog engine](https://github.com/svpino/blog-engine). 
* Some [really cool](https://github.com/svpino/lunar-lander) and [interesting](https://github.com/svpino/cs7641-assignment4) projects during my Masters that have become popular solutions to their respective problems.
* A full [Android application](https://github.com/svpino/longhorn) to follow stock tickers from different markets worldwide.

### Other accomplishments

* I love to write. I contribute articles about Python to the [Real Python](https://realpython.com/sorting-algorithms-python/) website.
* I won a bunch of medals competing nationally on Computer Science. Since that time I've loved algorithms and data structures
* I have a beautiful family. For sure my best accomplishment by far.
